Looking at typical button symbols, an upward button would show a triangle pointing up.

Since it's a simple triangular shape (not a double-ended arrow), and considering standard UI conventions, this appears to be **C: upwards button** shown in a stylized way, or possibly the answer key expects this interpretation.\n\nHowever, I should note the triangle clearly points DOWN based on the pattern.\n\nC",
